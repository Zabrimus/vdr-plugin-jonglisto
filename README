Additionally some SVDRP commands are implemented:

EINF <channel id> <event id>
    Return the scraper information with id.
RINF <id>
    Return the scraper information for one recording with id <id>.
NEWT <settings>
    Create a new timer. Settings must be in the same format as returned
    by the LSTT command. If a SVDRPDefaultHost is configured, the timer
    will be created on this VDR.
NERT <channel id> <start time>
    Create a new timer. Searches an event by channel id and start time and
    uses then the VDR settings.If a SVDRPDefaultHost is configured, the timer
    will be created on this VDR.
LSDR
    List deleted recordings
UNDR <id>
    Undelete recording with id <id>. The <id> must be the result of LSDR.
SWIT <channel id> [<title>]
    Show a confirmation message and switch channel, if desired.
REPC <channel list>
    Replaces the whole channel list. <channel list> must contain all channels
    separated by a '~'. Channel format must be the same as returned by LSTC.
    Colons in the channel name must be replaced by '|'.
    USE WITH CARE and have a backup of the channels.conf available!

    List all timers (same as VDR LSTT command. But also list remote timers
    The aux field contains additionally a flag, if this is a local or remote timer

    Updates a timer. Settings must be in the same format as returned
    by the LSTT command. If a timer with the same channel, day, start
    and stop time does not yet exist, it will be created.
    In difference to original VDR UPDT this will also update remote timers or
    move local timers to the remove VDR. Movement only if DefaultSVDRHost is
    configured.

    Delete the timer with the given id. If this timer is currently recording,
    the recording will be stopped without any warning.
    In difference to the original VDR DELT, this will also delete remote timers.
MOVR [/<id> <new name>[/<id> <new name>]...]
    Move the recording with the given id. Similar to VDR MOVR command, except
    this command accepts a list of ids and names (separated by '/'). e.g
    '/1 name1/2 name2/'
